## Web Mapping for Covid Cases in Washington State ##

The web maps under index.html and pop_density.html are responsible for showing applications of WEB Gis using HTML/CSS and JS with the Mapbox library.

The data for covid mapping was acquired through the Washington State Department of Health and the New York Times.

This activity also taught me how to use Mapbox in order to build out a cloropleth map and how color scaling can be achieved with the effective use of geoJson information and legends.
